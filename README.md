# C Programming Basics

This repository contains my solutions to basic C programming problems from my coursework at NIT Patna. I'm using this to practice my C skills and learn version control with Git.

## Problems Solved

### Lab 1: Introduction to C
* **`hello_world.c`**: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
* **`hello_world_quote.c`**: Prints a string containing double quotes.

### Lab 2: Operators
* **`arithmetic_ops.c`**: Performs basic arithmetic on two user-provided numbers.
* **`swap_with_temp.c`**: Swaps two numbers using a temporary variable.

### Lab 3: Bitwise Operations
* **`swap_with_bitwise.c`**: Swaps two numbers using the XOR bitwise operator.
* **`power_of_two.c`**: Checks if a number is a power of two using bitwise AND.
* **`toggle_certain_bits.c`**: Toggles the 2nd and 4th bits of a number using a mask.
* **`toggle_operation.c`**: Toggles any bit of a given number as per the user input.
* **`on_or_off.c`**: Checks if the 4th index bit posistion of a number input by user is ON or OFF.
* **`clear_bit.c`**: Clears the 5th bit of any integer input and gives the resulting integer after the operation.

### Lab 4: If-else statements
* **`largest_number.c`**: Checks for the largest input by the user among the three input numbers.
* **`positive_negative_zero.c`**: Checks if the input integer is positive, negative or zero.

### Lab 5: Loops (For,While,Do-While)
* **`one_to_n.c`**: Prints all the numbers from 1 to n, where n is input by the user using a for loop.
* **`sum_of_n_nat_nums.c`**: To print the sum of N natural numbers input by the user using a while loop.
* **`multiplication_table.c`**: A multiplication table of any number input by user using a for loop.
* **`find_num_of_digits.c`**: To check the number of digits of the input value using a do-while loop.
* **`even_in_range.c`**: To print all the even nums in input range using for loop.

### Lab 6: Arrays
